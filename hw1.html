      <!-- Think about inserting the meta description tag which is very much used by Google Search Engine 
         to describe your page - in your case, it could be something as: <meta name="description" 
         content="List of assignments made by Linda Sutanto for JavaScript, AJAX course at CSM"> 
         Also you should substitute the words CIS 114 by more meaningful words and well-known outside the 
         college in the title tag, in the content value of meta description and also in heading tags - 
         instead of CIS 114, it should be JavaScript, AJAX - you will enhance your SEO-->
